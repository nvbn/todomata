# todomata

Todo application with calculation of short path for completing all tasks.

Developed during participation in [clojurecup 2014](https://clojurecup.com/).

Short path will be calculated by:
* time in which task should be completed (example: from 2am to 5pm);
* place where task should be completed (example: shop, park);
* dependencies of task;
* priority of task.
